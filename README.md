## Getting Started
Simply install the `rainbow-tabs-evolved` package in your editor via the GUI. Alternatively, you can also do it via the command-line interface:

```bash
apm install rainbow-tabs-evolved
```

## Contributing
If you want more extensions supported, or want to override any of the current colours, please feel free to make a pull request.

The file you probably want to edit is [styles/rainbow-tabs.less](https://github.com/sbrl/rainbow-tabs/blob/master/styles/rainbow-tabs.less). Please keep the file extensions in alphabetical order :smiley_cat:

### Publishing
When publishing a new release, this is done via the `apm publish` command on the terminal like so:

```bash
apm publish 2.6.2 # Publish an explicit version number
apm publish minor # Make a new minor release
```
